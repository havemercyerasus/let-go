# Let Go

![Let Go](let_go.png "After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was unaffected.")

A chrome extension inspired by xkcd comic #862. Whenever you visit a site in the extension's "black list" you will be greeted by a random motivational quote and a countdown before being able to view the page. Both the black list and the countdown duration are set in the extension's options page.
